 * QUESTION 3
 *
 * For each month that had sales show a list of customers ordered by who spent the most to who spent least.
 * If the totals are the same then sort by customer.
 * If a customer has multiple products then order those products alphabetical.
 * Months with no sales should not show up.
 * Show the name of the customer, what products they bought and the total they spent.
 * Only show orders with the "Payment received" and "Dispatched" status.
 * If there are no results, then it should just say "There are no results available."
 *
 * Please make sure your code runs as effectively as it can.
 *
 * See test3.html for desired result.
